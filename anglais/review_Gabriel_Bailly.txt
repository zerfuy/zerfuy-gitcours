1 Introduction
    When it comes to TV shows, I often come to the demoralizing realization that I've seen just about everything. From disturbing-ish yet beautiful shows like Penny Dreadful to mainstream family-friendly shows like Friends, the overwhelming growth of online streaming platforms allows just about anyone to watch just about anything, and I am not one to fret from the quantity!

2 Likes and dislikes
    After that cheerful introduction, you might have already guessed that I quite enjoyed watching Ragnarok. The most attractive aspect of that tv show is the fact that it breathes Norwegian culture. It is fundamentally different from what we are used to see, and it works. It works astonishingly well. 

    In order not to spoil anybody, here are a few key facts: Magne, the protagonist, is a nice yet shy kid. his family just recently moved to the small village of Edda (where the view is heavenly). the town at first glace feels quite classical, and for the first half an hour or so you feel like you're watching a classic tv show. 

    Fortunately, after a short while the story unravels and you quickly start to understand that nothing is quite as it seems; indeed, the show addresses the issues of the destruction of the environment and an individual's identity in an impressively non-moralizing way, while cleverly mixing the intrigue with old Norwegian mythology. Every character is interesting, well rounded and it's easy to care about them since they all offer an outstanding performance.

3 My recommendation
    Should you watch Ragnarok? Well, you probably have noticed that there is no point I disliked about the tv show, so the answer would definitely be a yes from me. One the other hand, the cultural barrier may be offputting to some, and that might make you feel like you're watching a badly voiced B-series show... In the end, the choice is up to you but I strongly recommend you to watch it!
