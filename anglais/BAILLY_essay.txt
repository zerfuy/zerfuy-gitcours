advantages of welfare state

As we all know, welfare as part of our social fabric is nothing new. As a french citizen, I was born and raised in a society which's very fundations rely on an omnipresent welfare state. Based on my own experience and what i know from people who are close to me, I'd say that there are two main points as to why I believe deeply in a welfare state.

First of the two is the fact that a welfare state (even if it isn't always obvious) aims at providing people with equal opportunities in life. It allows every part of society to have a better shot at life, allowing them to negate their potentially inherited disadvantage at life. 
second in line is social security. That safety net can convince people to take financial risks in their life. Thanks to that concept, people are more likely to try and create their own enterprise for example. Additionnally, the net also gives a second chance to those who fail in doing so.
And finally, On a larger scale welfare provides a great and humane way to redistribute money in the country, helping the economy to flow normally.

But even if I, as a human, am convinced that a welfare state is a really great addition to any society I have to stress one obvious inconvenient about that system. This issue - without a surprise - is the few individuals who exploit the system and live off of other. They truly are the one and only downfall to a welfare state, and if noone behaved that way then all would be perfect in the best of worlds !
